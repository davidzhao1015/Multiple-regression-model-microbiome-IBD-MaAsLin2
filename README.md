# Multiple regression on microbiome and IBD covariates using MaAsLin2 R package
In the repository I built multivariate linear regression models to investigate effects of IBD covariables on fecal microbiome (compositions and functions) 
- MaAsLin2 R package was applied to implement modelling and visualization
- Microbiome abundance data, metadata and function data was provided by the R package MaAslin2 
- Markdown made R scripts reproducible and publishable in HTML format on GitHub pages\
