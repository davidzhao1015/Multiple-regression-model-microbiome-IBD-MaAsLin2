# Multiple regression on microbiome and IBD covariates using MaAsLin2 R package
In the repository I built multivariate linear regression models to investigate effects of IBD covariates on fecal microbiome (composition and function). 
- MaAsLin2 R package was applied to implement modelling and visuliazation
- Microbiome abundance data, metadata and function data was provided by the R pakcage MaAslin2 
- Markdown was applied to make R scripts reproducible and publishable in HTML format on GitHub pages
